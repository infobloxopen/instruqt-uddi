In this lab, you will get hands-on with Infoblox Universal DNS Management, a single solution for
visibility and control of DNS tools used across on-premises, hybrid, and multi-cloud networks. You will
begin with a tour of the centralized visibility and management for DNS, exploring the efficiency of the
consolidated Infoblox Portal. Then, you’ll manage DNS records in Azure DNS and AWS Route 53, using
the same Universal DDI interface and workflow to make updates across clouds.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> **NOTE:** This environment is *real*! AWS and Azure Cloud Accounts have been created for each student. No bitcoin mining, please! :)

In this section we will:
1) Review the cloud architecture
2) Login to your cloud account console's
3) Deploy resources onto your cloud regions
4) Create your Infoblox Portal user

---

## 1) Review Cloud Architecture
===

First lets review the cloud architecture that has been provision for your Infoblox Lab experience.

Navigate to the *Lab Diagram* tab above and review the diagram. This is what we're building today!




## 2) Login to your cloud account consoles
===
Using the credentials below, login to the AWS and Azure Web Consoles in their respective tabs above:

---
# AWS Credentials ☁️

Select "IAM Account" and enter the **AWS ID**:
```
[[ Instruqt-Var key="INSTRUQT_AWS_ACCOUNT_INFOBLOX_DEMO_ACCOUNT_ID" hostname="shell" ]]
```

**AWS Username**
```
[[ Instruqt-Var key="INSTRUQT_AWS_ACCOUNT_INFOBLOX_DEMO_USERNAME" hostname="shell" ]]
```

**AWS Password**
```
[[ Instruqt-Var key="INSTRUQT_AWS_ACCOUNT_INFOBLOX_DEMO_PASSWORD" hostname="shell" ]]
```

---

# AZURE Credentials ☁️

**AZURE SUBSCRIPTION**
```
[[ Instruqt-Var key="INSTRUQT_AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_INFOBLOX_TENANT_SUBSCRIPTION_ID" hostname="shell" ]]
```

**AZURE USERNAME**
```
[[ Instruqt-Var key="INSTRUQT_AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_INFOBLOX_TENANT_USERNAME" hostname="shell" ]]
```

**AZURE PASSWORD**
```
[[ Instruqt-Var key="INSTRUQT_AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_INFOBLOX_TENANT_PASSWORD" hostname="shell" ]]
```



## 3) Deploy resources onto your cloud regions
===

Now that you've logged into the cloud providers consoles its time to deploy resources for upcoming Instruqt Challenges:

### 1. Deploy AWS resources in EU

Apply the resources:

```run
cd ~/infoblox-lab/Infoblox-PoC/terraform
terraform apply --auto-approve  -target=module.aws__instances_eu -target=aws_ec2_transit_gateway.eu
```

Build connectivity between VPCs inside the region

```run
terraform apply --auto-approve  -target=aws_ec2_transit_gateway_route_table.tgw_rt -target=aws_ec2_transit_gateway_vpc_attachment.tgw_attachments -target=aws_ec2_transit_gateway_route_table_association.tgw_rt_associations -target=aws_route.tgw_routes -target=aws_ec2_transit_gateway_route.tgw_routes
```

Set up the DNS infrastructure with the appropriate VPC associations and A-records as outlined in the lab diagram.

```run
terraform apply --auto-approve -target=aws_route53_zone.private_zone -target=aws_route53_record.dns_records
```

### 2. Deploy Azure resources in North Europe

Apply the resources:

```run
terraform apply --auto-approve -target=module.azure_instances_eu
```

Build connectivity between Vnets in the region:

```run
terraform apply --auto-approve -target=azurerm_virtual_network_peering.vnet_peering
```

Set up the DNS infrastructure with the appropriate VPC associations and A-records as outlined in the lab diagram.


```run
terraform apply --auto-approve -target=azurerm_private_dns_zone.private_dns_azone -target=azurerm_private_dns_zone_virtual_network_link.eu_vnet_links -target=azurerm_private_dns_a_record.eu_dns_records
```


## 4) Create Admin User to your Infoblox Portal Dashboard
===

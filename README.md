# Welcome to Infoblox UDDI Lab 🎓

This is an **on-demand learning lab** built to help you get hands-on experience with **Infoblox Universal DNS Management (UDDI)** — a modern, cloud-delivered solution for managing DNS, DHCP, and IPAM across hybrid and multicloud environments.

Each student receives a **dedicated sandbox** with:
- Real **AWS**, **Azure**, and **GCP** cloud accounts
- Pre-provisioned infrastructure and cloud-native resources
- Fully isolated access to run and test each scenario

Each challenge must be completed in order. Inside each folder, you'll find an `assignment.md` with a clear storyline, tasks, and user guidance.

2. Open the `assignment.md` file to begin your first challenge.
3. Follow the instructions provided to complete each step before moving to the next one.
